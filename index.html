              This site (the html thingy) was written by a backend dev. You are not going to see fireworks here.

        <h4>A little bit about me</h4>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                Everything is pretty simple here. It is my daily activity to do researches based
                on anything that gets my attention (mostly related to computer science, and science in general). <br>
                One more thing. I suggest watching "Attack on Titan" or "Your Name" (animes), you will definitely love it.
                If you need a longer list, contact me, I'll provide you with my favourite ones.
            </p>

        <!-- this is what you came for -->
        <h4>What I know?</h4>
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5>Python</h5>
                <p>

                    This is something I'm good at. I have
                    <script>
                        document.write(get_years(2016));
                    </script>
                     of experience. It's what it's.
                </p>
            <h5>Django</h5>
                <p>
                    I've been working on Django projects since 2018. I've been focusing on backend development since then.
                    I'm not good at making front-end parts (well, I'm bad at it).
                </p>
            <h5>Django Rest Framework</h5>
                <p>
                    <script>
                        document.write(get_years(2020));
                    </script>
                     of experience. I was supposed to work on a project that requires it,
                    so here we go. Since then I'm learning it...
                </p>
            <h5>C, C++, Java, Swift, C#, JavaScript</h5>
                <p>
                    Don't get the wrong idea. I don't know all of these languages well. I used Java for Android development
                    during my freshman year at university (overall 1 year of experience on android development).<br>
                    I've completed a course on Swift during a quarantine, and developed a little iOS app. But that doesn't
                    make me an iOS dev.<br>
                    I know basics of C, C++, C# and JS. But never done a project with them.
                </p>
            <h5>Docker, Docker-compose</h5>
                <p>
                    I've started working with these containerization tools in 2020 (due to my job). <br>
                    <script>
                        document.write(get_years(2020));
                    </script> of experience, that means I already have a good level of understanding of these tools and I can get the job done.
                </p>
            <h5>Telegram bots</h5>
             <p>
                 I've been developing Telegram bots since I started programming. I've done many orders based on bots,
                 and I'm pretty sure I can develop any kind of possible Telegram bot at this rate.
             </p>
            <h5>PostgreSQL, SQLite</h5>
                <p>
                    Well, I always use Postgres with ORM (Django ORM) since I started using Django, but I can get the
                    job done with raw sql queries if necessary.
                </p>
            <h5>HTML, CSS</h5>
                <p>
                    You are watching what I can do with HTML, CSS. I opened boostrtap docs, tried to use some cool things there
                    and ended up using this p, h, div... things. If you need a front-end dev, close this tab, exit the site.
                </p>
            <h5>Version control</h5>
                <p>
                    Git (hub, lab, ?..).
                    I'm good at using it, but it's not fun to participate in 'git wars', or more properly 'merge wars'.
                </p>
