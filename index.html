              This site (the html thingy) was written by a backend dev. You are not going to see fireworks here.
              You deserve the right not to read all of the content on this page, thanks.

        <h4>A little bit about me</h4>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p>
                Completing the tasks? It is my job. Watching animes is something I do enjoy. It is my daily activity to do researches based
                on anything that got my attention (mostly related to computer science, and science in general). <br>
                Was that part about animes a joke? No. I suggest watching Attack on Titans, you will definitely love it.
                 If you need a longer list, contact me, I'll provide you with my favourite ones.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>What I know?</h4>
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5>Python</h5>
                <p>
                    This is something I'm good at. I have <code>{THIS_YEAR-2016}</code> years of experience. It's what it's.
                </p>
            <h5>Django</h5>
                <p>
                    I've been working on Django projects since 2018. I've been focusing on backend development since then.
                    I'm not good at making front-end parts (well, I'm bad at it).
                </p>
            <h5>Django Rest Framework</h5>
                <p>
                    I started using this framework in 2020. I was supposed to work on a project that requires it,
                    so here we go. Since then I'm learning it...
                </p>
            <h5>C, C++, Java, Swift, C#</h5>
                <p>
                    Don't get the wrong idea. I don't know all of these languages well. I used Java for Android development
                    during my freshman year at university (overall 1 year of experience on android development).<br>
                    I've completed a course on Swift during a quarantine, and developed a little iOS app. But that doesn't
                    make me an iOS dev.<br>
                    I know basics of C, C++ and C#. But never done a project with them.
                </p>
            <h5>Docker, Docker-compose</h5>
                <p>
                    I've started working with these containerization tools in 2020 (due to my job). <br>
                    If <code>{THIS_YEAR-2020} >= 1</code>, that means I already have a good level of understanding of these tools and I can get the job done.
                </p>
            <h5>Telegram bots</h5>
             <p>
                 I've been developing Telegram bots since I started programming. I've done many orders based on bots,
                 and I'm pretty sure I can develop any kind of possible Telegram bot at this rate.
             </p>
            <h5>PostgreSQL, SQLite</h5>
                <p>
                    Well, I always use Postgres with ORM (Django ORM) since I started using Django, but I can get the
                    job done with raw sql queries if necessary.
                </p>
            <h5>HTML, CSS</h5>
                <p>
                    You are watching what I can do with HTML, CSS. I opened boostrtap docs, tried to use some cool things there
                    and ended up using this p, h, div... things. If you need a front-end dev, close this tab, exit the site.
                </p>
